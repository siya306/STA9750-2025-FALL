    "text": "Executive Summary\nThis research investigates the Netflix Top 10 dataset, concentrating on how episodes and films performed in various countries. I used R and tidyverse tools to wrangle, filter, and summarise data in order to answer important analytical questions. The study focuses on patterns such as the longest-running series, debut week performances, and US film rankings. The analysis illustrates not only raw data insights, but also how to effectively explain outcomes. All code is integrated to ensure transparency and repeatability.\n\n\nIntroduction\nNetflix has grown into a global streaming powerhouse, producing and distributing content in more than 90 countries. This dataset, which records weekly Top 10 rankings, provides insights into which shows and films are most popular around the world.\nThe project’s purpose is to use R to answer a series of structured questions. These include determining the longest-running shows on Top 10 lists, highlighting exceptional premiere weeks, and evaluating trends in specific areas such as the United States.\n\n\n\nNetflix Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Acquire Data\nThe datasets used include:\n\nGlobal Top 10: weekly Top 10 shows and films worldwide.\n\nCountry Top 10: weekly Top 10 shows and films per country.\n\n\n\nCode\nif(!dir.exists(file.path(\"data\", \"mp01\"))){\n    dir.create(file.path(\"data\", \"mp01\"), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)\n}\n\nGLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME &lt;- file.path(\"data\", \"mp01\", \"global_top10_alltime.csv\")\n\nif(!file.exists(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)){\n    download.file(\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-global.tsv\", \n                  destfile=GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)\n}\n\n\nCOUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME &lt;- file.path(\"data\", \"mp01\", \"country_top10_alltime.csv\")\n\n\nif(!file.exists(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)){\n    download.file(\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-countries.tsv\", \n                  destfile=COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)\n}\n\n\nStoring the data locally makes sure that it can be used again. Anyone who runs this report again can automatically get the right datasets if they are missing.\n\n\n2.

This allows us to understand the dataset before deeper analysis.\n\n\nExploratory Questions\n\n\n1. How many different countries does Netflix operate in?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nnum_countries &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  distinct(country_name) %&gt;%\n  nrow()\nnum_countries\n\n\n[1] 94\n\n\nThe number of countries Netflix operates in is 94.\nThis shows how global Netflix is and how well it has localized content for a wide range of audiences.\n\n\n2. Which non-English-language film has spent the most cumulative weeks in the global top 10? How many weeks did it spend?\n\n\nCode\nnon_english_top &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(!str_detect(category,\"Films English\")) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 1) %&gt;%\n  select(show_title, cumulative_weeks_in_top_10)\n\nnon_english_top\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  show_title cumulative_weeks_in_top_10\n  &lt;chr&gt;                           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Squid Game                         32\n\n\nThe non-English-language film that spent the most cumulative weeks in the global Top 10 is Squid Game, with 32 weeks.\nNon-English hits show how Netflix is trying to diversify its content around the world. Regional films that do well on global charts show that they appeal to everyone.\n\n\n3. What is the longest film (English or non-English) to have ever appeared in the Netflix global Top 10? How long is it in minutes?\n\n\nCode\nlongest_film &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  mutate(runtime_minutes = round(runtime * 60)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(runtime_minutes)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 1) %&gt;%\n  select(show_title, runtime_minutes)\n\nlongest_film\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  show_title     runtime_minutes\n  &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Until You Burn            2855\n\n\nThe longest film to appear in the global Top 10 is Until You Burn, with a runtime of 2855 minutes.\nNon-English hits demonstrate Netflix’s strategy of global content diversification. Success in global charts proves the universal appeal of regional films.\n\n\n4. For each of the four categories, what program has the most total hours of global viewership?\n\n\nCode\ntop_viewed_per_category &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  group_by(category, show_title) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(category) %&gt;%\n  slice_max(total_hours, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  arrange(category)\n\ntop_viewed_per_category\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n# Groups:   category [4]\n  category            show_title          total_hours\n  &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Films (English)     KPop Demon Hunters    591300000\n2 Films (Non-English) Society of the Snow   235900000\n3 TV (English)        Stranger Things      2967980000\n4 TV (Non-English)    Squid Game           5048300000\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(DT)\ntop_viewed_per_category %&gt;%\n  datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Which TV show had the longest run in a country’s Top 10? How long and where?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(DT)\n\nlongest_run &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10 == max(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  select(show_title, country_name, cumulative_weeks_in_top_10) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\n# Display as interactive table\ndatatable(longest_run, \n          options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE),\n          rownames = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of how local favorites can shape cultural watching habits for years.\n\n\n6. Netflix provides over 200 weeks of service history for all but one country in our data set. Which country is this and when did Netflix cease operations in that country?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\ncountry_short_history &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  group_by(country_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_weeks = n_distinct(week),    # count unique weeks, not rows\n    last_week = max(week)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(total_weeks &lt; 200)\n\ncountry_short_history\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  country_name total_weeks last_week \n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;int&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1 Russia                35 2022-02-27\n\n\nThe country with less than 200 weeks of Netflix service is Russia, which ceased operations on 2022-02-27.\nThis suggests Netflix exited that market, possibly due to business or regulatory challenges.\n\n\n7. What is the total viewership of the TV show Squid Game? Note that there are three seasons total and we are looking for the total number of hours watched across all seasons.\n\n\nCode\nsquid_game_hours &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(show_title, \"Squid Game\")) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nsquid_game_hours\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  total_hours\n        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  5310000000\n\n\nThe total global viewership of Squid Game across all seasons is 5.31^{9} hours.\nThis number illustrates Netflix’s biggest-ever hit, validating investments in international originals.\n\n\n8. The movie Red Notice has a runtime of 1 hour and 58 minutes. Approximately how many views did it receive in 2021? Note that Netflix does not provide the weekly_views values that far back in the past, but you can compute it yourself using the total view time and the runtime.\n\n\nCode\nred_notice_views &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(show_title, \"Red Notice\") & year(week) == 2021) %&gt;%\n  mutate(views_estimate = weekly_hours_viewed / (1 + 58/60)) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_views = sum(views_estimate, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nred_notice_views\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  total_views\n        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  201732203.\n\n\nRed Notice received approximately 2.017322^{8} views in 2021.\nThis calculation uses runtime to estimate views, showing how viewership estimates can be derived indirectly when raw counts aren’t given.\n\n\n9. How many Films reached Number 1 in the US but did not originally debut there? That is, find films that first appeared on the Top 10 chart at, e.g., Number 4 but then became more popular and eventually hit Number 1? What is the most recent film to pull this off?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Filter US films and summarize\nus_films &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(country_iso2 == \"US\", str_detect(category, \"Films\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(show_title) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    first_rank = min(weekly_rank, na.rm = TRUE),\n    ever_number1 = any(weekly_rank == 1, na.rm = TRUE),\n    last_week = max(week, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(first_rank &gt; 1 & ever_number1) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(last_week))\n\n# Number of films\nnum_us_films &lt;- nrow(us_films)\n\n# Most recent film to reach #1\nmost_recent_film &lt;- us_films$show_title[1]\n\n# Inline code in Quarto\nnum_us_films   # use in text: `r num_us_films`\n\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nCode\nmost_recent_film  # use in text: `r most_recent_film`\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nThe number of Films that reached Number 1 in the US but did not debut there is 0.\n\n\n10. Which TV show/season hit the top 10 in the most countries in its debut week? In how many countries did it chart?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\ntop_show &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  group_by(show_title, country_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(debut_week = min(week), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(show_title, debut_week) %&gt;%\n  summarise(num_countries = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  slice_max(num_countries, n = 1) %&gt;% \n  slice(1)                             \n\ntop_show$show_title   \n\n\n[1] \"Army of Thieves\"\n\n\nCode\ntop_show$num_countries  \n\n\n[1] 94\n\n\nThe TV show/season that hit the top 10 in the most countries in its debut week is Army of Thieves, appearing in 94 countries.\nThis reflects a global marketing push or universal story appeal, making the show an instant worldwide hit.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this project used coding, statistical analysis, and data visualization to find important information on how Netflix’s global Top 10 movies and shows did. We were able to clean, investigate, and analyze massive datasets by working through R and Quarto in a methodical way. This helped us answer concerns regarding international reach, the dominance of non-English titles, and the record-breaking runs of popular shows and movies. The code not only made it easier to do tedious math, including figuring out how many views a video gets, tracking how well a video does in different regions, and counting total views, but it also made the analysis clear and easy to repeat. Cultural events like Squid Game changed the way people around the world enjoy entertainment, while movies like Red Notice highlighted how big Netflix’s star-driven initiatives are. At the same time, regional trends and shows that slowly ascended to the top showed how different people like different things. This mix of coding and storytelling shows how data science can turn raw streaming data into a story about how Netflix has changed how people watch TV around the world.\n\n\nPress-Release\n\nPress Release 1: Upcoming Season of Stranger Things\n\n\nThe Grand Finale “The Upside Down Returns: Stranger Things Ends With a Global Spectacle”.\n\n\n\nNetflix Logo\n\n\nThe fifth and last season of Stranger Things will come out on Netflix at the end of 2025.

Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives, Hi Papa (Hindi), and Sir (Hindi) were all big hits with audiences, each staying popular for more than 25 weeks. In 2024, Hindi viewership frequently went over 15 million hours a week, adding up to 183 million hours for the year. This means that there are about 730,000 active users in India, which shows how important the region is becoming as Netflix’s next big thing. Long-term trends demonstrate that Hindi content is not only getting more people to watch it, but it’s also keeping them interested for years. The number of Hindi movies in India’s Top 10 has been continuously rising, their average runs are getting longer, and their watching peaks are getting higher with stronger weekly baselines. These trends suggest that Netflix will continue to gain subscribers in India, which is an important part of the company’s worldwide growth strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact: RRR (Hindi) alone spent almost 5.5 years in India’s Top 10 charts, which is longer than most movies stay in theaters around the world!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Release 3: OWN TOPIC\n\n\nNetflix Celebrates the Global Success of Non-English Originals.\n\n\n\nNetflix Logo\n\n\nNetflix keeps breaking down barriersby making non-English TV shows and movies popular all around the world. This shows that great tales can be told in any language. Squid Game is a landmark achievement with over 5.31 billion hours seen worldwide and 32 weeks in the Global Top 10. Money Heist, a Spanish-language hit, spent an incredible 127 weeks in a single country’s Top 10 (Pakistan), showing how long it can stay popular. Hindi hits like RRR (Hindi) and Kantara (Hindi) kept this trend going, showing how India’s influence on global viewing patterns is growing. Netflix is putting more money into local productions that create global cultural moments and help the company build its subscriber base over time. This is because non-English originals always do well in different locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact:Squid Game alone had more viewers around the world than many Hollywood blockbusters combined, with over 5.3 billion hours viewed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact: By the end of 2024, almost half of all Netflix viewing hours came from titles that weren’t in English. This shows that people’s tastes had changed around the world.\n\n\n\nREFERENCE CODES FOR PRESS RELEASES:\n\nPRESS RELEASE 1\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nstranger_things_global &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(show_title, \"Stranger Things\")) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_weeks_in_top10 = sum(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nstranger_things_countries &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(show_title, \"Stranger Things\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(country_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(debut_week = min(week), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  summarise(num_countries = n())\n\nstranger_things_stats &lt;- cbind(stranger_things_global, stranger_things_countries)\nstranger_things_stats\n\n\n  total_hours total_weeks_in_top10 num_countries\n1  2967980000                  366            93\n\n\n\nPRESS RELEASE 2\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nindia_hindi &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(country_iso2 == \"IN\", str_detect(show_title, \"Hindi|Bollywood\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(show_title) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_weeks_in_top10 = sum(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(total_weeks_in_top10))\n\n\ntop_india_hindi &lt;- india_hindi %&gt;% slice_head(n = 5)\ntop_india_hindi\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  show_title                        total_weeks_in_top10\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 RRR (Hindi)                                        325\n2 Kantara (Hindi)                                     66\n3 Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives                   34\n4 Hi Papa (Hindi)                                     28\n5 Sir (Hindi)                                         28\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nhindi_hours &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(show_title, \"(Hindi)\")) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nhindi_hours\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  total_hours\n        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   183000000\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhindi_total_hours &lt;- 1.83e+08  \n\nassumed_hours &lt;- c(240, 250, 300)\n\nsubs_estimates &lt;- data.frame(\n  hours_per_user_year = assumed_hours,\n  estimated_subscribers = hindi_total_hours / assumed_hours\n)\n\nsubs_estimates\n\n\n  hours_per_user_year estimated_subscribers\n1                 240                762500\n2                 250                732000\n3                 300                610000\n\n\n\nPRESS RELEASE 3\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr); library(stringr)\nsquid_stats &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(show_title, \"Squid Game\")) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),\n    weeks_global_top10 = max(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\nsquid_stats\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  total_hours weeks_global_top10\n        &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  5310000000                 32\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmh_long_run &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(show_title, \"Money Heist\")) %&gt;%\n  slice_max(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  select(show_title, country_name, cumulative_weeks_in_top_10)\nmh_long_run\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  show_title  country_name cumulative_weeks_in_top_10\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Money Heist Pakistan                            127\n\n\n\n\nCode\nindia_hindi_examples &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %&gt;%\n  filter(country_name == \"India\", str_detect(show_title, \"\\\\(Hindi\\\\)\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(show_title) %&gt;%\n  summarise(weeks_in_top10 = max(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10, na.rm = TRUE), .groups=\"drop\") %&gt;%\n  filter(show_title %in% c(\"RRR (Hindi)\", \"Kantara (Hindi)\"))\nindia_hindi_examples\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  show_title      weeks_in_top10\n  &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Kantara (Hindi)             11\n2 RRR (Hindi)                 25"
